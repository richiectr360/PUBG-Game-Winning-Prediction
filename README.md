## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze and predict outcomes in the popular online multiplayer battle royale game, PUBG (PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds). Using data-driven insights, the project seeks to understand the factors that contribute to player success and predict game outcomes based on player performance metrics.

## Methodology

The analysis involves several key steps:

- **Data Collection**: Gathering comprehensive gameplay data, including player statistics, match details, and environmental factors.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis, addressing missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and exploring data to uncover initial insights and trends related to player performance and game dynamics.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Implementing machine learning algorithms to predict game outcomes based on a set of player and game features. Models may include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or advanced ensemble methods.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Datasets

The project utilizes PUBG game data, which includes:

- **Player statistics**: Kills, assists, damage dealt, distance covered, survival time, etc.
- **Match details**: Match type, number of players, game duration, final standings, etc.
